# Application R_Shiny : Project Overview
* Within the university framework I create a simple RShiny App to analyze the climate in different cities of France.
* We use a csv file for year 1973 to 20116 to do a simple analysis.
* The goal of this project is to understand the basics of R_Shiny.
* To run this App, you just need to open the "Global.R" and run it.
